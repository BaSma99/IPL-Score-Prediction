## **IPL Score Prediction**
Since its inception in 2008, the IPL has garnered a global audience, thanks to its high level of unpredictability and thrilling last-minute finishes that keep fans glued to their screens. In a relatively short time, the IPL has emerged as cricket's most lucrative league in terms of revenue. Cricket matches often feature scoreline predictions indicating a team's likelihood of winning based on the current game situation, a task typically accomplished using data analytics. Prior to the advent of machine learning, such predictions relied on intuition or rudimentary algorithms. The aforementioned scenario clearly illustrates the limitations of using run rate as the sole factor in predicting the final score of a limited-overs cricket match.
## **Why Choose Deep Learning?**
Humans struggle to identify patterns within vast datasets, which is where machine learning and deep learning shine. These technologies excel at recognizing patterns, particularly in the context of sports like cricket. By analyzing how players and teams have historically performed against specific opponents, these systems can be trained to make more accurate predictions. While traditional machine learning algorithms offer moderate accuracy, deep learning surpasses them by considering a wider array of attributes, leading to significantly improved performance. To facilitate this advanced analysis, tools like Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, and Visual Studio are commonly used due to their robust capabilities.
